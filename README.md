# Vehicle Detection from Aerial Images using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a vehicle detection system using deep learning techniques, specifically YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN, applied to aerial images. The system aims to accurately detect vehicles in urban areas from high-resolution aerial photographs, contributing to applications in surveillance, traffic management, and urban planning.
